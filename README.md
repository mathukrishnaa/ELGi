User Story: Lego Game
Objective:
As an enthusiastic fan of Lego and a computer science under-grad with very limited allowance, buying real Lego sets was an expensive choice which I chose to give up. I decided to use the virtual 3d Lego game which I can play whenever I want and create unlimited number and any possible types of pieces and without taking up any physical space and for completely free.
Scenario: Playing the game
1.	Starting the game:
o	Given the user is on the start screen,
o	When the user clicks on the "Start" button,
2.	Creating and placing blocks:
o	The user can click on any of the block button to spawn in a piece of their choice on the spawn platform ,
o	Then the user can drag the piece onto a platform that looks like a chessboard which is going to be the base of any build.
o	The user can spawn in any number of blocks, drag it onto the platform and place it there or stack it on top of each other
3.	Saving the game:
o	After building, the user can click on save button to save his progress so that it wonâ€™t be erased when he leaves the game.
o	The user can continue the game from that point at any later time.


Acceptance Criteria: 
 
The acceptance criteria for the Lego Game include the user being able to start a new game with an empty base and buttons to spawn in pieces, the ability to drag the pieces and place it on the platform or stack it on top of one another. The user must be able to save his current progress with a click of a button and be able to continue it later on.
